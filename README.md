# Navidrome - Spotify UI

This project is a web-based, Spotify-inspired user interface for the Navidrome music server. It's a self-contained, single-file application that connects to your personal Navidrome instance via the Subsonic API, providing a modern and familiar way to browse and play your music library.

Your server credentials are saved securely in your browser's local storage and are never stored within the file itself.

**Features:**

- Full Library Browse: Navigate your entire collection by Songs, Albums, and Artists.
- Complete Playlist Management: View, play, create, edit, and delete your playlists. You can also add songs to and remove songs from any playlist.

**AI-Assisted Development
**
This project was developed in collaboration with Google's Gemini AI. The process involved a series of prompts and iterative refinements to build the features, design the layout, and debug the code. It serves as an example of human-AI partnership in software development.
